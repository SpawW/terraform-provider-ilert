# iLert Provider Examples

This directory contains a set of examples of using various iLert resources with
Terraform. The examples each have their own README containing more details
on what the example does.

To run any example, clone the repository and run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` within
the example's own directory.

For example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iLert/terraform-provider-ilert
cd terraform-provider-ilert/examples/alert_source
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
...
```
